Pin tool outputs to protect them from automatic pruning.

## IMPORTANT: The Prunable List
A `<prunable-tools>` list is provided to you showing available tool outputs you can pin. Each line has the format `ID: tool, parameter` (e.g., `20: read, /path/to/file.ts`). You MUST only use numeric IDs that appear in this list.

## When to Use This Tool

Use `pin` to preserve context you'll need for upcoming work:

- **Active work:** Files you're about to edit or reference
- **Key context:** Important information needed for the current task
- **Dependencies:** Code or data that informs your next steps

## When NOT to Use This Tool

- **Completed work:** If you're done with the context and won't need it again
- **Noise:** Irrelevant or superseded outputs - let them be auto-pruned

## Pin Expiration

Pins expire automatically after a set number of turns. You don't need to unpin - just let pins expire naturally. If you pin something that's already pinned, its expiration will be extended.

## Best Practices

- **Pin sparingly:** Only pin what you actively need - unpinned outputs will be discarded at the next auto-prune cycle
- **Think ahead:** Before the auto-prune warning, consider what context you'll need for upcoming work
- **Let go:** When work is complete, let the context be auto-pruned rather than pinning everything

## Format

- `ids`: Array of numeric IDs as strings from the `<prunable-tools>` list

## Example

```
Assistant: [Sees auto-prune warning, reviews prunable tools]
I need to keep the auth service file since I'm about to modify it.
[Uses pin with ids: ["10", "15"]]
```
